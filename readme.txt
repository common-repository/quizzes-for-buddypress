Control BuddyPress groups membership through quizzes from popular quiz plugins. Currently supports <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/watu/">Watu</a>, <a href="http://calendarscripts.info/watupro/">WatuPRO</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/chained-quiz/">Chained Quiz</a>.

== Description ==

This is a quiz connector between the quiz plugins Watu, WatuPRO, Chained Quiz and the [BuddyPress](https://buddypress.org/ "BuddyPress"). 

Use the quizzes from powerful third party quiz plugins to control members joining groups. You can automatically join user to a group when certain quiz is completed with a defined result or is completed at all. 

### Currently Supported Plugins ###

* [Watu](https://wordpress.org/plugins/watu/advanced/ "Watu") (free)
* [WatuPRO](http://calendarscripts.info/watupro/ "WatuPRO") (premium)
* [Chained quiz](https://wordpress.org/plugins/chained-quiz/ "Chained Quiz") 

* Ask for more in the forum

### How Does It Work ###

* Select which of the supported plugins you want to integrate. The plugin(s) must be installed and active.
* Go to Rules and define some rules. You need to have some groups and some quizzes already created.
* Each rule can define the following condition:
a) The quiz that should be completed
b) The required grade(s) / result(s) if any
c) Minimum % correct answers for knowledge quizzes.
* Then you can define either that completing the quiz will automatically join the user to the associated group or the quiz completion will be required in order to allow joining the group. You can as well select both.

The integration is work in progress, your suggestions and contributions are most welcome!
